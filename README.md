Free CMS for motorcycle workshops to manage customers, vehicles, orders, invoices & stocks easily & transparently

== Description ==

Having had the opportunity to get to know you mechanics several times over the years and to look over your shoulders, the following IT problems have been expressed time and again:

- the Internet does not work
- the computer / the Internet is too slow
- my program costs annual license / support fees
- my workshop program is too complicated & can do things that are not relevant for me
- yet another update with new features that I don't need / understand
- The list of dissatisfactions could go on and on...

Out of gratitude, respect and recognition of your skills and courage to run a workshop in these days, I have tried to pay you back with the “my workshop” application.

This is based on the principle of concentrating on customer / vehicle & material / parts management. Please do not expect an integrated accounting system with simple or even double-entry bookkeeping. I assume that you will either let a tax office do it anyway or possibly even do it yourself with specialized programs.

Other “Chi-Chi” functionalities have also been omitted (e.g. calendar, statistics, project management, etc.) I am convinced that you can do this faster and better with your usual “office tools”!
